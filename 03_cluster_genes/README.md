The scripts in this folder were used to call the Differentially Expressed Genes(DEGs) of each cluster versus the other clusters by Monocle.

Two files are required:
1) Gene Expressioin Matrix: Cells by Genes, normalized/scaled (100K) and log-transformed:(LOGe(counts+1)).
2) scMINER clustering file: including 4 columns-CellID, tSNE-x, tSNEy and ClusterLabel.

Introduction of related scripts/files
1) 00_Cluster_Gene_Analysis_Template_byMonocle.R: core codes to call DEGs by Monocle.
2) 01_sample_list.txt: configure file with five columns -- SampleName, Species, GeneExpressionMatrix, ClusteringResult and OutputDirectory.
3) 02_Rcodes_prepare.pl: Perl script used to generate R codes for each samples listed in 01_sample_list.txt.
4) 03_Cluster_Gene_Analysis.sh: generated by 02_Rcodes_prepare.pl.
